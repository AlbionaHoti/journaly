## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository!  
   `$ git clone git@github.com:Journaly/journaly.git`
2. In your backend directory, locate your `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env` along with replacing the values in that file - **it's important to complete this step first**
3. In the root of the project (`journaly/`), run `docker-compose up` - this should spin up the entire app for you, just like that!

Not only do you now have the entire journaly app and all its 3 services running, but you have a local PostgreSQL database instance running on your machine with persistant storage! :)

4. Let's seed that baby DB!  
   `$ ts-node prisma/seed.ts`

BOOM! You now have some users, along with a selection of posts :)
